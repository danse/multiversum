Publishing research notes to push some explorations beyond the individual perspective.

# Equinox

Today is the spring equinox. I wanted to publish a product today, and the only product can be this post.

My research went in multiple directions and it's the moment to pack the current status somehow.

Through the `equinox` project i could evolve my set of results about task management models.

The ranksieve method was an happy spinoff, it opened wide areas of design thinking, like the desire for nestable structures.

For equinox i updated about state management frameworks, finding a fresh and diverse panorama where quality seems to abund.

User centered development was harder than expected given my strict technological constraints.

I want to compare state management with a complex client tree with graph query languages, and i found out that projects like the interplanetary file system can overlap their features with those of pouch.

The react/redux hegemony feels a bit chilling in 2019.

The documentation of vuex was made by unicorns.

The [Simple Store Pattern](https://vuejs.org/v2/guide/state-management.html#Simple-State-Management-from-Scratch) is something id'like to experiment with.

# The Interdisciplinary Institute

Is an amazing hybrid as you can find in Barcellona's scene.

The [research groups are on a quest for the future](uoc.edu/portal/en/in3/recerca/grups/index.html)

- the _computational social science_ group publishes about the theories we wish we knew
- the _urban transformation and global change_ group seems to work by many related threads
- _care and preparedness in the network society_ also follows several threads, some of which i feel to relate strongly

Here the professionality feels very different from punk business, yet these folks are obviously cool.

# Better Resume

`danse/resume` did not evolve as good as `salomonelli/best-resume-ever`, and the data caravan here is easy because they follow the same simple structure, they work like template stamps.

## Best Resume Ever

For a freelancer it's nice to have a _projects_ section, since projects often don't fit linear timelines.

I guess that adaptation here is achieved with the data brittleness. A template like _creative_ can simply skip the _projects_ branch.

`best-resume-ever` turns out to be written in vue, which was a fantastic surprise as i've got to vue through very different paths a few days before i met it again trough another valuable project!

A template is an elegant `creative.vue`.

Customising as easy as `background-color: @accent-color;`.

# Portfolio

I expressed my last projects in terms of the users, the team and the goals, as an experiment to structure a portfolio. The experiment was killed by the expectation of me being on LinkedIn.

Hakyll gives me freedom by template files like:

- `default.html`, `post-list.html`, `post.html`, `portfolio.html`
- `visual.html`, `media.html`, `gallery.html`, `projects.html`

They could adjust swiftly to changes if i got used to update them more often.

De todos los servicios comerciales que vi, Carbonmade.com me convencío más.

Ranksieve will flow somewhere near to my portfolio

# Product Prototyping

Ranksieve emerged out of our daily off-online, off-ongrid, off-ondevice routine research.

Designing for mobile ended up feeling like picking from a popular compatible framework.

I wonder about the mobile media input experience.

I can solve some manipulation problems with popups.

I would love to experiment with a picker and a range for rank editing.

I am not sure that i want to dive into _sortable_ mechanics.

Checklist controls can undoubtly be convenient in this domain.

I love the swipeout interaction.

I could easily use Digital Ocean to serve a static website.

I settled on Vue rather quickly. I went through React tutorials several times in the past years, and Vue felt to the point, refreshing!

Ranksieve evolved very rapidly and its legacy are now few unpacked lines of code and an unstable system. I can experiment on this while i keep studying.

Mobile development introduced too much friction, i have been sick many days and that stopped the web development. Here i have a topic for a postmortem.

Essential screens like a _ranksieve packs page_ and a _daily done counter_ would be enough to build a minimal app. An alternative set is _ranks_ + _funnel_ + _gauge_ because the latest version obscillate around a point of equilibrium.

# Multiversum

Writing on bad network one could have issues or a misconfiguration or might simply try to get to a new performance profile.

Can we mix a content delivery network into parts of the interplanetary filesystem?

Interplanetary feels like it evolved from radical scenarios.

Both `profilo.svg` and `tu, io.png` went to space at light speed under their interplanetary names `QmYnjEMnXFLv1M9m6A9WnadRzE9ShW2BAWtHu1GGHFcjQj` and `QmUba4mdUemNWw4ehEPAsJqwDfPUudvRyoefhsjY4rhg9X`.

Blogging in R could become fun as i found out about [Blogdown](github.com/rstudio/blogdown), [Bookdown](github.com/rstudio/bookdown) and [Hugo Themes](themes.gohugo.io)

Referencing is as simple as writing `~/multiversum/media-ranks/1.png`. That can easily be dereferenced in Vim or Emacs.
