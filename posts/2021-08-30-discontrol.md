Here i summarize some ideas collected years ago. I was improving my
process of note taking and information management. I wanted to be
supported by tools that enabled me to keep track of research and leave
my mind free for reflection. I found that many tools i was using
tended to affect too much the course of my actions, for instance with
advertisement and algorithms.

As most of the content in multiversum, these fragments are not ready
for a public. They organise some information for my understanding and
for archival.

## Stacks

I started from stacking notes in my editor as i was looking for a
connection between portable digital and physical algorithms.

Editing the stack of notes i used to repeat some actions. I thought
they could be a good starting point for automation and i collected a
few patterns, like usability primitives. They did not leave much track
in the code because i could not automate fast enough to follow
evolution of usage.

I tried using the notes as in a deque. Used as a queue it circled
threads for shortest time, used as a stacks it circled them for
longest time. Reordering is possible but expensive, so items get
popped mostly from the top or the bottom.

The anonymicity of items in a stack is the optimal condition at the
moment of storing but the worse at the moment of accessing,
retrieving. That's why many stacks benefit from processing strategies
and that's why it makes sense to have some abstract concepts of the
tip of a stack and the heterarchy of priorities. It's an heterarchy
without a common root, leading to the development of multiple paths
and multiple new roots.

Since it is difficult to reorder items in a stack, the stack growing
algorithm is important. An important part of the algorithm is where to
insert new items and were to pick existing ones from for processing.

Keeping pointers, cursors and bookmarks is an important part of
managing information. I wanted to have pointers on my stacks, but also
to keep pointers to other information like web addresses and emails.

The tip of a first-in, first-out stack is like a mark on moving
matter. It is giving us some consistency, but not topic consistency.

When an human is working on such a stack, the tip is the exposed part,
which will be read multiple parts by who is using it.

Loading through a memory pass a root taints anything that leads there

It's the system of recursive amplification that leads to
directionality of chaotic systems over time and makes stacks so
powerful.

One of the primitives was to _lift_, that is to move back to the empty
part of a tip and center.

I wanted a bookmark like a pointer to a filesystem path.

## Grounds

Whichever frame is unsuited to an everchanging ground.

Deepening starts when one is able to move the focus to some ground,
which is chaotic.

Growing complexity as a feature of successful diving.

Some reactions give us a ton of matter out of nothing. For instance
when we find an interesting page or we receive mail, that can spawn a
list of other elements to be deepened, and we want to keep track of
our path from the original document through the derived ones.

The tip of the ground for input, the tip of the roots is for output.

## Roots

`roots` is a named pointer that i ported also to paper archives and
mobile phones. I was trying to rely on a concept that can be as
portable as possible. The roots are a growing structure which is
supposed to be suitable to the ground.

The root is the place where ideas reach us and become ours.  When they
hit us they create a branch that has our setting on it and that can
keep branching, giving us more options.

Un'idea sulla radice si può continuare a sviluppare o vivere di più.

A root is easier to analise than a process.  One can select specific
conditions desired in the setting, for example productivity and
comfort.  Work for the conditions to be there then detect when they
get lost.

Circuits provide control: empty spaces, polished surfaces, threads,
routines. Even when delicate and flexible. A root can be a checkpoint
in a routine.

Work as an activity grounded on (regulated by) money making or
productivity can be seen as paths to a desirable root.

A conversation can be seen as a shared root.

Pop in versus pop out frequencies.

## Receptive strategies

Rooting was part of a research in methods that were inclusive while
keeping a direction. Ways to affect the uncontrolled.

This is better defined in terms of using metrics like the time spent
on different tasks. I tried to go beyond metrics while using them.
metrics are like doors for goals to be achieved and could eventually
be redefined. L'esplorazione di uno spazio che ha più dimensioni di
quelle tracciate come una linea che percorre una sfera.

Drifting from a root rather than aiming for a topic.

Over control.

Around rooting i tried other strategies. The main idea behind them was
to break free from the main driving direction and leave room for
interferences to become new priorities. That can appear as _laming_ or
wandering. Another technique was _triggering_, which can be done in a
confusing way by stopping right before a goal.
