<p>I started quite a lonely journey in the past weeks, looking for a job with Haskell. I looked at all resources offered by the community, at the main employment sites, i stalked some companies which were supposed to use Haskell internally, i completed my profile on sites for remote work and i applied to some jobs which had no constraints about the technology to be used.</p>
<p>Now i seem arrived at a dead end, it seems to me that there is no other place left to try or to look into. In a perfect world, i would have no reason to feel stuck, because my interests would lead me to like-minded people. So if i am interested in Haskell, i could just start using it to fix problems, and find travel companions along the way.</p>
<p>I think that i will actually try this. I just need to withstand the pressure of being without a job, out of the stream, on my own.</p>
