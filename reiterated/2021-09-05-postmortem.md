title: postmortem summer 2017
----

Since when i started nomading my approach to work changed more and
more. Then after nowhere i was challenging my most fundamental habits.

Travelling through peripherical places in the middle of summer, also
my technologies and logistics were challenged to a point where i could
collect only a small amount of productive hours.

In these conditions, i started working for two clients simultaneously
for two projects that were rather challenging in very different ways.
I refused to be stressed, but couldn't avoid being somehow stressed.

I reacted and recovered, and i learned that my productivity was below
my own expectations. I consider my contribution to one of those
projects successful, and my contribution to the other project
unsuccessful.
