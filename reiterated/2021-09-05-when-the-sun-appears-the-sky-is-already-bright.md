title: when the sun appears, the sky is already bright

> we found ourselves in the wrong place
> at the wrong time
> and loneliness is a cradle
> and the endless night welcomes its rhythm
> our eyes wouldn't close, while our soul found a roof
> clearly we didn't count the hours
> because our dark cover is now leaving us exposed
> 
> when a slow conflict fires the sky
> slowly light flows everywhere
> birds sing, fishes populate the sea
> everything is so quiet now, it's already day
> and the sun is still not there
> 
> maybe we don't care about it after all
> our sky is all ready for a new boring day
> when some clouds start looking funny
> strokes of light catch our eye on them
> then they blur, then they expand
> we tought the sky was bright, but it keeps changing
> the light we didn't expect keeps glowing
> it starts feeling glorious, and the sun is still not there
> 
> now we don't really need it
> this is everything we wanted
> we found ourselves at the other end of society
> at the other end of our wandering
> exhausted and surprised, we realise this day is ours
> and the sun
