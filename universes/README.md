This is a space for atomic, self-contained parts of the site, which
can vary a lot in style, technology and code organisation.

As a rule, for now, i could say that every universe should not link to
resources in other universes directly. This way i will know that, when
deleting an universe, i will not have to update any other universe,
but in case just the main pages of Multiversum.

All the resources will have to be controlled by Git, which can get
quite verbose in the logs, but for the moment i don't have a better
idea in order to achieve independence from the technology
