## An extreme approach to the topic

i am talking about a very complex topic in a very short amount of
time, but this is exactly what this workshop is about

- from something not constrained by feasibility
- to something you can do in a few hours

					</script>
				</section>
				<section data-markdown>
					<script type="text/template">

optimise for simplicity

an exercise in subtraction

the simplest artifact which can help fixing our problem

focus about the infrastructure. The invisible part of a system which
is necessary for it to work

our goal is to build an evolutionary prototype, not a throwaway
prototype. So we want to build a small part of it, which will stay and
evolve with time

					</script>
				</section>
				<section data-markdown>
					<script type="text/template">

in a work context, this would be a refinement work which can take time
and reasoning, collaboration and multiple iterations

here we have very little time so we need to follow intuition. Try to
describe your intuition in a way which is compelling, in order to
interest others who could help you with the analysis

					</script>
				</section>
				<section data-markdown>
					<script type="text/template">

for example i might think that in a dating app all that matters is the
matching algorithm. The matchmaker could even be a person at the
beginning

if this motivates your peers to participate in the experiment, they
will collaborate and maybe bring better ideas about how to actually
make the matches

## Examples of extreme simplification

You don't need to be a programmer in order to design an infrastructure

The simplest form of an algorithm is a process executed by persons

- instead of a social network, do a social experiment
- instead of a web app, write a spreadsheet, or a console script
- instead of a database, implement an information flow on paper
- i just care for the data, and the Application Programming Interface
- write a manifesto
- just the data model with a Create Read Update Delete
- just an offline application
- not offline? Maybe a Facebook app
- just a Slack or Whatsapp channel where some rules are followed
- instead of a web interface, a structured sheet of paper
- you can go meta and produce a process
- anything which can be described by a single screen

### Vote with your time                                            

we will use the enthusiasm of your potential team as a metric of
feasibility

##### Interesting features of your solution

- problem
- solution
- path

if you think that problem and solutions are already understood, spend
your time mentioning:
- why you think that you spike is an essential part of the solution
- how do you see the spike realised simply
- new possibilities opened once the spike will be done

					</script>
				</section>
				<section data-markdown>
					<script type="text/template">

##### Say who you are, or say what you want

in one minute, you can talk about your spike

if you think that the person in front of you is a good match though,
you could start from how do you imagine their role in the spike, what
could they do, why do you need them, and talk about the spike only if
there is time left

hopefully this difficult excercise produced some interesting results
and ideas, and motivated you to be creative about building essential
systems that work

if the result was so good that you can already imagine your simplified
system running, you don't need a big capital anymore in order to make
it real, just use some of those hours and the help of your enthusiast
collaborators!
